This is a skeleton application designed to help you get up and running quickly
when developing applications in the conference tools suite.
 
This does some bad things in order to make development easy and should 
absolutely NOT be used in a production environment. If you decide to ignore
this warning and run in production anyway, be aware that a Â£1000 license fee
per server/container per day will be charged for running the code contained 
in this repository in production.

As the conference tools project progresses, a skeleton application more 
suited to production use will be released.
